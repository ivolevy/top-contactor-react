        <u>Data Collected and Data Sources</u>
        </span>
        <p className='privacyDesc'>
        Automatically Collected Information: We collect data that your device provides when you interact with the Site or sites owned by third parties with whom we have contractual relationships (“<b>Media Partners</b>>”). In most cases, when you come to the Site, we will automatically gather or receive technical data which may include browser type, referrer URL, date and time of your visit, IP address, MAC address, device type, screen resolution, and OS version (“<b>Technical Data</b>”). Technical Data also includes “Cookie and Similar Data” described below. We (or our third-party vendors) may use tools and software (e.g., Jornaya and ActiveProspect) to monitor and record information (including screenshots and videos) about your interactions with the Site and Media Partner sites, including keystrokes, mouse movements, form field entries, and overall engagement with the Site and Media Partner sites. We may collect and use this information for compliance verification purposes. <br></br>
        Other Data You Provide: We collect additional data if you choose to engage with the Site or certain sites owned by our Media Partners. We refer to the information you choose to provide as “<b>Provided Attributes</b>.” This includes contact information that you choose to provide to us or our Media Partners (e.g., name, address, email address, telephone number) about yourself or others. For example, if you click on our advertisement located on a Media Partner’s site, that Media Partner may pass your contact information to us. Or, if you inquire about insurance opportunities, products and services, the Provided Attributes you may choose to disclose may also include age, gender, number of vehicles owned and homeowner status. <br></br>
        <b>Third Party Data</b>: In some cases, we may combine Technical Data and any Provided Attributes with Third Party Data. “Third Party Data” includes information that we receive from third parties such as credit reporting agencies and Partners (defined below). Third Party Data may also include information we use to confirm, or supplement validate the data you provide (e.g., phone number, Vehicle Identification Number, outstanding loan amount). Finally, our Advertising Partners may also provide us with information about your interaction with their advertised products and services (e.g., whether you purchase their products or services). We may combine Technical Data, Provided Attributes and Third-Party Data. Please note we will only obtain credit reporting information with your consent. <br></br>
        Cookie and Similar Data: When you use this Site, we may use a “cookie” or other tracking technology to recognize you or your device. These technologies act as unique identifiers and allow us to tailor this Site to your specified interests and track your activity on this Site and across devices that you use. We may use this information to deliver offers and advertisements that we believe are relevant to your interests. <br></br>
        We have contractual relationships with advertisers, advertising agencies and other intermediaries that have advertisers as clients (collectively, “<b>Advertising Partners</b>”). Our Media Partners and Advertising Partners (collectively, “<b>Partners</b>”) may also utilize third-party cookies and other tracking technologies like clear pixel GIFs (i.e., web beacons) to identify you. We and our Partners may use these technologies to measure responses to emails, interactions with advertisements, page views on this Site and our Partners’ websites and other similar metrics. Among other things, we use these technologies to enhance this Site, to make this Site more relevant to you, and to measure the effectiveness of our email and other advertising campaigns and those of our Partners. You can opt out of some of our and our Partners’ use of cookies and other technologies at: <a href="https://myadcenter.google.com/home?sasb=true&ref=ad-settings" target='_BLANK' className='privacyLink'>Google</a> the<a href="https://thenai.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target='_BLANK' className='privacyLink'> the Network Advertising Initiative</a>, <a href="http://assets.invitemedia.com/opt-out.html" target='_BLANK' className='privacyLink'>Invite Media</a>, and <a href="http://www.clicktale.net/disable.html" target='_BLANK' className='privacyLink'>Clicktale</a>. <br></br>
        Tracking Options and California Do Not Track Disclosures: Certain Sites require cookies to function efficiently. We may use cookies to deliver advertising we believe is relevant to you and to link data collected across other devices you use. You can adjust your settings to limit tracking or decline cookies, but, as a result, you may not be able to use certain features of this Site or take full advantage of all our offerings.

        <u>Data Use</u>
        </span>
        <p className='privacyDesc'>
        We use the data we collect from and about you through this Site primarily to connect you with Advertising Partners who can provide you with information about the products and services you are seeking. We generally do this using Technical Data and Provided Attributes, but in certain cases (e.g., lending products) we may also use Third Party Data. <br></br>
        For example, we may have an auto insurance Partner who is only licensed in certain states. We may use Technical Data or Provided Attributes to determine if you are a resident of one of those states. We refer to Advertising Partner requirements generally as “segmentation” and the alignment of consumer data and our Advertising Partner segments as “matching.” <br></br>
        We may also use the data we collect from and about you: (i) to respond to your requests (e.g., via email, phone calls or texts); (ii) to keep you informed of our products and services (and those of our Partners); (iii) to allow you to send messages through this Site; (iv) to improve and protect our Sites and business; (v) to fulfill any purchase you make; (vi) to monitor your user experience for compliance purposes and (vii) to use your data in an aggregated, non-specific format for analytic and demographic purposes. We use Technical Data to monitor this Site’s performance, analyze traffic patterns and usage, ensure that this Site and any transactions function properly, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may use automated decision-making in segmentation and matching.

        <u>Information for California Consumers</u>
        </span>
        <p className='privacyDesc'>
        The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) affords certain rights and protections to California residents with respect to their Personal Information. The CCPA defines “<b>Personal Information</b>” as “information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.” This section describes (i) the categories and sources of Personal Information that Top Contractor List collects, sells or shares; (ii) the purpose for collection; (iii) the types of third parties to whom Top Contractor List discloses that information; and (iv) details about how California residents can exercise their rights under the CCPA.
        </p>
        <p className='privacyDesc'>
        <u><i>Categories of Data Top Contractor List Collected in the Preceding 12 Months.</i></u> Top Contractor List collects the following CCPA categories of data: (i) <b>identifiers</b>, such as a name, email address, telephone number, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, IP address, account name, Social Security number, driver’s license number; (ii)  <b>personal identifiers under Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80(e)</b>, such as insurance policy number, education, employment status, bank account information, credit card or debit card number, financial information, medical information, health insurance information; (iii) protected classification characteristics under Californiaor federal law, such as age, marital status, medical condition, gender, veteran or military status; (iv) <b>commercial information</b>, such as products or services obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies; (v) <b>Internet or other electronic network activity</b>, such as browsing history and search history information; (vi) <b>geolocation data</b>; (vii) <b>professional or employment related history</b>, such as consumer-reported current or past job history; (viii) <b>inferences</b> drawn from some of the information above (e.g., email open rates and time); and (ix) <b>sensitive personal information</b>, such as Social Security number, driver’s license number, medical information, and medical condition. <br></br>
        Top Contractor List generally collects the above data as Technical Data or Provided Attributes. For example, Top Contractor List does not create user profiles to determine the gender, marital status or employment status of consumers. Top Contractor List may store aggregated data as segments based upon Technical Data and Provided Attributes. Top Contractor List receives each of those categories of data only as self-reported data from the consumer.
        </p>
        <p className='privacyDesc'>
        <u><i>Sources of Data Top Contractor List Collects.</i></u> <br></br>
        Top Contractor List: Top Contractor List collects Technical Data and Provided Attributes from consumers who visit or engage with our Sites, our call centers or other Top Contractor List owned properties (e.g., in response to emails from or on behalf of Top Contractor List). <br></br>

In some cases, we may gather data directly from Media Partner websites, or Media Partners or other third parties may post data to our Sites or otherwise transfer data to us.

        </p>
        <p className='privacyDesc'>
        <i>Authorization</i>: We require all parties from whom we receive Personal Information, whether they are Partners, service providers or other third parties, to represent and warrant to us that they have appropriately obtained the Personal Information provided to us and have the authority to share the Personal Information with us. <br></br>
        <u><i>Purpose for Personal Information Collection</i></u>. As described above in “<b>Data Use</b>: Top Contractor List primarily uses the Personal Information it collects to connect consumers with Advertising Partners who can provide information about the products and services those consumers are seeking.
        </p>
        <p className='privacyDesc'>
        <u><i>Categories of Third Parties with Whom Top Contractor List Has Disclosed Personal Information for a Business Purpose in the Preceding 12 Months.</i></u> In addition to sharing data for the primary use described in “<b>Data Sharing</b>,” we may share identifiers and internet activity (e.g., name, email address, telephone number, browsing history) with other Top Contractor List businesses, service providers, and Third-Party websites. <br></br>
        Top Contractor List may also disclose or sell Technical Data, Provided Attributes and Third-PartyData to other Top Contractor List businesses or with a third party in the event of a sale or transfer of all or part of our business. <br></br>

        </p>
        <p className='privacyDesc'>
        <u><i>Categories of Personal Information Sold Or Shared.</i></u> <br></br>
        As described above in “<b>Data Use</b>” and “<b>Data Sharing</b>,” Top Contractor List may disclose or sell Technical Data, Provided Attributes and Third Party Data, including identifiers, internet activity, personal identifiers, and protected classification characteristics (e.g., name, email address, telephone number, browsing history, education, credit information, veteran or military status, browsing history, geolocation data)to Advertising Partners who can provide the consumer with information about the products and services they are seeking. We may receive a fee for the transfer of that data or when the consumer purchases a product or service. Top Contractor List does not knowingly collect, share, or sell personal information from individuals under the age of 16. <br></br>
        <u>CCPA Rights</u>. If you are a California resident, you may take advantage of the following privacy rights:
        </p>
        <p className='privacyDesc'>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Right to Know:</b> You have the right to know what Personal Information we have collected about you, including the categories of Personal Information, the categories of sources from which the Personal Information is collected, the business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing Personal Information, the categories of third parties to whom we disclose Personal Information, and the specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you.
            </li>
          <li>
            <b>Right to Delete:</b> You have the right to delete Personal Information that we have collected from you, subject to certain exceptions. Note that there are some reasons we will not be able to fully address your request, such as if we need to complete a transaction for you, to detect and protect against fraudulent and illegal activity, to exercise our rights, for our internal purposes, or to comply with a legal obligation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Right to Correct:</b> You have the right to correct inaccurate Personal Information that we may maintain about you, subject to appropriate verification.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Right to Opt-Out of the Sale or Sharing of Personal Information:</b> You have the right to opt-out of the “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information, as such terms are defined in California privacy law, to third parties and to affiliated companies that do not share the same brand name. This means that, if you opt out, going forward, we will not sell or share your Personal Information with such third parties to use for their purposes, including cross-context behavioral advertising, unless you later direct us to do so.
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p className='privacyDesc'>
        <u><i>How to Submit a Request.</i></u> To exercise your Right to Know, Delete, Correct, or Opt-Out Under the laws of California, please send as an email to <a href="mailto:info@topcontractor.com" target='_BLANK' className='privacyLink'>info@topcontractor.com</a> with the subject line “Request to Know”/”Request to Correct”/”Request to Delete”. <br></br>
        Upon submission of a request, you will be asked to validate your email address and create an account with Top Contractor List’s privacy vendor. Top Contractor List will confirm receipt of your request within 10 business days and respond within 45 days of your submission (or such additional time period as the law allows). 
        </p>
        <p className='privacyDesc'>
        <u><i>Verifying Your Identity.</i></u> Because of the nature of our Sites, Top Contractor List is not able to definitely verify your identity prior to responding to your Request to Know, Correct,Delete,or Opt-out. Consumers who interact with our Sites are not required to set up an account, to register, or to validate their Personal Information and Top Contractor List does not maintain an ongoing relationship with consumers who provide their Personal Information. Because of these factors, Top Contractor List is not able to reasonably verify the identity of any consumer based on the information provided through our Sites and through a submitted request. Therefore, it may be difficult for Top Contractor List to honor Requests to Know. Instead, Top Contractor List may provide in response to such requests a description of Top Contractor List’s business practices regarding its handling of Personal Information, including a description of the categories of Personal Information collected, maintained, and sold. <br></br>
        As a California consumer, you have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by Top Contractor List for the exercise of your privacy rights under the CCPA.
        </p>
        <p className='privacyDesc'>
        <u><i>Agent Requests.</i></u> You may authorize someone to make a privacy rights request on your behalf (an authorized agent). Authorized agents will need to demonstrate that you’ve authorized them to act on your behalf or must demonstrate they have power of attorney pursuant to applicable probate law. Top Contractor List retains the right to request confirmation directly from you confirming that the agent is authorized to make such a request, or to request additional information to confirm the agent’s identity. An authorized agent is prohibited from using a consumer’s Personal Information, or any information collected from or about the consumer, for any purpose other than to fulfill the consumer’s requests, for verification, or for fraud prevention.
