        <u>Data Collected and Data Sources</u>
        </span>
        <p className='privacyDesc'>
        Automatically Collected Information: We collect data that your device provides when you interact with the Site or sites owned by third parties with whom we have contractual relationships (“<b>Media Partners</b>>”). In most cases, when you come to the Site, we will automatically gather or receive technical data which may include browser type, referrer URL, date and time of your visit, IP address, MAC address, device type, screen resolution, and OS version (“<b>Technical Data</b>”). Technical Data also includes “Cookie and Similar Data” described below. We (or our third-party vendors) may use tools and software (e.g., Jornaya and ActiveProspect) to monitor and record information (including screenshots and videos) about your interactions with the Site and Media Partner sites, including keystrokes, mouse movements, form field entries, and overall engagement with the Site and Media Partner sites. We may collect and use this information for compliance verification purposes. <br></br>
        Other Data You Provide: We collect additional data if you choose to engage with the Site or certain sites owned by our Media Partners. We refer to the information you choose to provide as “<b>Provided Attributes</b>.” This includes contact information that you choose to provide to us or our Media Partners (e.g., name, address, email address, telephone number) about yourself or others. For example, if you click on our advertisement located on a Media Partner’s site, that Media Partner may pass your contact information to us. Or, if you inquire about insurance opportunities, products and services, the Provided Attributes you may choose to disclose may also include age, gender, number of vehicles owned and homeowner status. <br></br>
        <b>Third Party Data</b>: In some cases, we may combine Technical Data and any Provided Attributes with Third Party Data. “Third Party Data” includes information that we receive from third parties such as credit reporting agencies and Partners (defined below). Third Party Data may also include information we use to confirm, or supplement validate the data you provide (e.g., phone number, Vehicle Identification Number, outstanding loan amount). Finally, our Advertising Partners may also provide us with information about your interaction with their advertised products and services (e.g., whether you purchase their products or services). We may combine Technical Data, Provided Attributes and Third-Party Data. Please note we will only obtain credit reporting information with your consent. <br></br>
        Cookie and Similar Data: When you use this Site, we may use a “cookie” or other tracking technology to recognize you or your device. These technologies act as unique identifiers and allow us to tailor this Site to your specified interests and track your activity on this Site and across devices that you use. We may use this information to deliver offers and advertisements that we believe are relevant to your interests. <br></br>
        We have contractual relationships with advertisers, advertising agencies and other intermediaries that have advertisers as clients (collectively, “<b>Advertising Partners</b>”). Our Media Partners and Advertising Partners (collectively, “<b>Partners</b>”) may also utilize third-party cookies and other tracking technologies like clear pixel GIFs (i.e., web beacons) to identify you. We and our Partners may use these technologies to measure responses to emails, interactions with advertisements, page views on this Site and our Partners’ websites and other similar metrics. Among other things, we use these technologies to enhance this Site, to make this Site more relevant to you, and to measure the effectiveness of our email and other advertising campaigns and those of our Partners. You can opt out of some of our and our Partners’ use of cookies and other technologies at: <a href="https://myadcenter.google.com/home?sasb=true&ref=ad-settings" target='_BLANK' className='privacyLink'>Google</a> the<a href="https://thenai.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target='_BLANK' className='privacyLink'> the Network Advertising Initiative</a>, <a href="http://assets.invitemedia.com/opt-out.html" target='_BLANK' className='privacyLink'>Invite Media</a>, and <a href="http://www.clicktale.net/disable.html" target='_BLANK' className='privacyLink'>Clicktale</a>. <br></br>
        Tracking Options and California Do Not Track Disclosures: Certain Sites require cookies to function efficiently. We may use cookies to deliver advertising we believe is relevant to you and to link data collected across other devices you use. You can adjust your settings to limit tracking or decline cookies, but, as a result, you may not be able to use certain features of this Site or take full advantage of all our offerings. Please refer to your device or browser settings for more information on how to delete or decline cookies and control your tracking preferences. This Site does not respond to Do Not Track signals from most browsers.

        <u>Data Use</u>
        </span>
        <p className='privacyDesc'>
        We use the data we collect from and about you through this Site primarily to connect you with Advertising Partners who can provide you with information about the products and services you are seeking. We generally do this using Technical Data and Provided Attributes, but in certain cases (e.g., lending products) we may also use Third Party Data. <br></br>
        For example, we may have an auto insurance Partner who is only licensed in certain states. We may use Technical Data or Provided Attributes to determine if you are a resident of one of those states. We refer to Advertising Partner requirements generally as “segmentation” and the alignment of consumer data and our Advertising Partner segments as “matching.” <br></br>
        We may also use the data we collect from and about you: (i) to respond to your requests (e.g., via email, phone calls or texts); (ii) to keep you informed of our products and services (and those of our Partners); (iii) to allow you to send messages through this Site; (iv) to improve and protect our Sites and business; (v) to fulfill any purchase you make; (vi) to monitor your user experience for compliance purposes and (vii) to use your data in an aggregated, non-specific format for analytic and demographic purposes. We use Technical Data to monitor this Site’s performance, analyze traffic patterns and usage, ensure that this Site and any transactions function properly, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may use automated decision-making in segmentation and matching.

        <u>Data Sharing</u>
        </span>
        <p className='privacyDesc'>
        In addition to the primary uses described in the “<b>Data Use</b>” section above (i.e., sharing your data with Advertising Partners and third parties for the purpose of providing you with information about the products and services you are seeking), we may share your data as follows: (i) with other Top Contractor List businesses; (ii) with service providers who assist us in compliance and verification activities (e.g., credit agencies), or provide services such as payment processing, IT, and data analysis; (iii) if you choose to send a message through, or to contribute to public areas of, this Site (e.g., message boards, blogs); and (iv) with a third party in the event of a sale or transfer of all or part of our business. <br></br>
        We may also disclose the data we collect from and about you to (i) comply with legal processes; (ii) to respond to lawful requests from authorities (including public and government authorities outside your state or country of residence, and including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements); (iii) to enforce our Terms of Service and this Privacy Notice; (iv) to protect our business, rights, privacy, safety, or property or that of others; and (v) as necessary under applicable law (including laws outside your state or country of residence).
